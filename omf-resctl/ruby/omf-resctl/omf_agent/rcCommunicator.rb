#
# This class defines a Communicator entity using the Publish/Subscribe paradigm.
# The Node Agent (NA) aka Resource Controller will use this Communicator to 
# send/receive messages to/from the Node Handler (EC) aka Experiment Controller
# This Communicator is based on the Singleton design pattern.
