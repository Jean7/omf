# OMF

## Introduction

OMF is a framework for controlling, instrumenting, and managing experimental platforms (testbeds).

* Researchers use OMF to describe, instrument, and execute their experiments.

* Testbed providers use OMF to make their resources discoverable, control access to them, optimise their utilisation through virtualisation, and federation with other testbeds.
