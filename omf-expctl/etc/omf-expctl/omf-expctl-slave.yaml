    :default:
    
      # This is the default name for the default testbed
      # EC will use this name if NO domain has been given on the command lide ( -d option)
      # This is optional. When 'name' is not present, the EC will take the first
      # sub-domain of the host it is executing on as the default testbed name.
      # (e.g. domain: 'indoor.nicta.com.au' will result in the name 'indoor')
      # IMPORTANT: 
      #   Your Inventory database *must* hold information about the testbed you name 
      #   (e.g. the 'testbeds' table must have an entry corresponding to this name)

    #
    # To use this testbed, call Experiment Controller with the option PRINT_ONLY or "-d debug"
    # Any parameter settings within this section will override the settings 
    # done in the "default" section. The Experiment Controller first loads the "default"
    # settings, then it uses the "domain" specific settings to override the 
    # relevant parameters
