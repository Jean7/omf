    # Config Parameter for the "default" Testbed
    # IMPORTANT:
    # There has to be a default domain defined here
    # do not add a colon ':' in front of any domain name
    default:
    
      # This is the default name for the default testbed
      # EC will use this name if NO domain has been given on the command line ( -d option)
      # This is optional. When 'name' is not present, the EC will take the first
      # sub-domain of the host it is executing on as the default testbed name.
      # (e.g. domain: 'indoor.nicta.com.au' will result in the name 'indoor')
      # IMPORTANT: 
      #   Your Inventory database *must* hold information about the testbed you name 
      #   (e.g. the 'testbeds' table must have an entry corresponding to this name)
      :domain: 'sandbox2'

      # This is the Path where EC should look for its repository of built in experiments
      # (e.g. example experiments, maintenance experiments, etc...)

      # This is the Url where EC can contact the Inventory Service
      :inventory:
        :url: 'http://localhost:5022/inventory'

      # This is the host address/name where EC serves its web server interface
      # This needs to be explicitly specified. For example the machine running EC can 
      # have multiple IP addresses, but only one would be accessible from outside a 
      # firewall

    # Config Parameter for the "planetlab" Testbed
    #
    # Optional here, since all the above config  
    # Just put it to remember that this EC can run experiments on some PL nodes.
    # (this is possible because our Inventory Service has information about a 'planetlab' testbed...)

    # Config Parameter for the "debug" Testbed
    #
    # To use this testbed, call EC with the option PRINT_ONLY or "-d debug"
    # Any parameter settings within this section will override the settings 
    # done in the "default" section. The EC first loads the "default"
    # settings, then it uses the "domain" specific settings to override the 
    # relevant parameters
