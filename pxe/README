IMPORTANT: to build the PXE kernel and image, make sure you run Ubuntu
9.10 32bit with the pkg.mytestbed.net apt source enabled in
/etc/apt/sources.list !

The purpose of this is to get get you a small PXE busybox frisbee image you 
can use to then image nodes and then kexec() to the respective desired
loaded kernel from the image(s) deployed.

You get two guys from this:

* Latest Linux kernel, configured to build the smallest kernel possible
* initramfs with busybox, frisbee, nodeagent and kexec


PREPARATION FOR BUILD:
To save answering all the questions about which modules to build, there
are some standard .config files in the config subdirectory.
Edit site.mk and change KERNEL_CONFIG_FILE to the config file
matching the kernel that is used (see Makefile).
