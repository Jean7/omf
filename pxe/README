The purpose of this is to get get you a small PXE busybox frisbee image you 
can use to then image nodes and then kexec() to the respective desired
loaded kernel from the image(s) deployed.

You get two guys from this:

* Latest Linux kernel, configured to build the smallest kernel possible
* initramfs with busybox, frisbee, nodeagent and kexec


PREPARATION FOR BUILD:
To save answering all the questions about which modules to build, there
are some standard .config files in the config subdirectory.
Copy the most recent of these to .config is src/linux-2.6.{x.y}
before running a first time build.
